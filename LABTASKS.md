#Lab Tasks

## Part 1: Exploring the project

- Set up this project to use Travis CI, and add your build status icon to the README.

##### What are the differences between the folder structure of this project and the previous one? Note that api/pets is server-side routing specific to the database, and the client folder contains the client-side portion of the project.

- This lab has separate folders for client and server. The javascript files on the client side are stored in the related folders.

##### How is app.js (at the project root) different from the ones in the previous two labs? Give examples of the kinds of urls that app.js handles, and describe where each case will be routed.

- This lab uses app.use for api routing and the other labs do not have api routing. '/*' routes to the index and '*' routes to the 404 pages as a wild card.

##### The project is connected to the database via mongoose. Where is this connection set?

- In app.js var mongoConfig = require('./config/mongo.js'); is set

##### Explain how api/pets/pets.controller.js gets added to app.js (remember this is all server-side).

- It is added in app.js in the app.use similar to how routes get added.

##### Study the file api/pets/pets.controller.js, answer the following questions:

-  What kind of documents would the database contain? What is the field in the model?

- the database contains json objects and the field is a string Pet.

-  What functions are defined in the controller? How do they change the database data?

- The functions defined are index, create, and destroy. It adds or removes json items from the database, or returns an item.

-  How does one get or delete elements in the database?

- They can use the destroy and find functions

##### What is the purpose of index.js in the api/pets? Where is it referenced?

- It defines the API for pets.

##### What views are used in the project?

- 404, main, about.

##### We've seen a few different ways to display HTML in the last couple labs (straight, individual HTML pages and components being added to HTML). How are HTML files combined and displayed in this lab? 

- They are assembled using angular to form the pages and change the elements in a page.

>Protip: main.html isn't a full HTML document, so how does it get displayed?

##### Where is the code for the navigation bar located? How is it connected to the pages of the project?

##### client/app.js performs client-side routing. How do you think it works?

## Part 2: Add another field to pet data.

- Add a numeric field to the pet model (say, for example, weight). Add a field to enter weight when a new pet document is created. Add a field in the main page to show the heaviest of all pets and its weight. Remember to practice TDD and perform frequent commits.

>Protip: Make sure to separate business logic functions from functions that make http calls. That is, don't have a function that performs both. This alows for optimal testing conditions.

## Part 3: Add a GPA calculator

- Add a view to enter courses and display the GPA. Add a link on the navigation bar that leads to it; add the corresponding route. Entered courses (name, credits, letter grade) must be stored in the database. Practice TDD and perform frequent commits. Don't forget to add new files to git before committing. Use the refactoring menu when renaming files (this will rename then in the git repo as well). Remember to check out you test coverage, and watch your build history on Travis-CI.
